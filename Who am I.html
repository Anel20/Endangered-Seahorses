         Maybe some of you, feel more confident in visiting websites, when you know who host them. Well, if that's your case
       I might a bit dissapoint you, because I am just a teen-girl,  my name is Anel, and I am from Kazakhstan.  The only sea we
        have here is Caspian sea, which is basicaly enormous lake; and I've never been there. Anyway, I've visited other seas.
        And I always had an interest in mysterious underwater world, and its habitants. I liked seahorses, because they seemed so
        cute to me! And after finding out about them more they got my interest even more, but the horrible thing is that they are
       endangered. So to help prevent this little fishes, I've decided to make a website which will raise awareness and suggest
       relevant solutions!</pre>
